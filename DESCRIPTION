Description: We provide functions for identifying the core community phylogeny in any microbiome, drawing phylogenetic Venn diagrams, calculating the core Faithâ€™s PD for a set of communities, and calculating the core UniFrac distance between two sets of communities. All functions rely on construction of a core community phylogeny, which is a phylogeny where branches are defined based on their presence in multiple samples from a single type of habitat. Our package provides two options for constructing the core community phylogeny, a tip-based approach, where the core community phylogeny is identified based on incidence of leaf nodes and a branch-based approach, where the core community phylogeny is identified based on incidence of individual branches. We suggest use of the microViz package.
